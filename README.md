## Databricks Execution Steps

1. **Open Databricks Workspace:**  Navigate to your Databricks workspace.
2. **Create a New Notebook:**  Click on **Create** and select **Notebook**.
3. **Set Language:** Choose the language (Python, R, SQL, etc.) for your notebook based on your preferences.
4. **Import the Required Libraries:** In the first cell of your notebook, import any necessary libraries for your project. For example:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   ```
5. **Upload Data:** You can upload datasets using the **Upload Data** feature or connect to your data source (e.g., S3, Azure Blob).
6. **Execute Code Cells:** Run your code in sequential cells just like you would in local Python execution. Use the **Run Cell** button or keyboard shortcuts to execute your code.
7. **Save Your Work:** Regularly save your notebook by hitting **File > Save** or using keyboard shortcuts.
8. **Schedule Jobs (Optional):** If you'd like to automate execution, use the Jobs feature in Databricks to schedule your notebooks.
9. **Export Notebook (Optional):** Once your work is complete, you can export the notebook as a file by selecting **File > Export**.

Feel free to customize these steps based on the specific needs of your project.
